# Recommendation-System
A recommendation system is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that is designed to make personalized suggestions to users based on their preferences and behavior. These systems are commonly used in a variety of applications, such as e-commerce, social media, and entertainment.

Recommendation systems use a variety of techniques, such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid methods, to analyze data on users and items to make personalized recommendations. They can also incorporate other sources of information, such as demographic data, to improve the accuracy of their recommendations. The goal of a recommendation system is to provide users with relevant, personalized suggestions that will improve their experience and increase engagement. For example, an e-commerce site might use a recommendation system to suggest products that a user is likely to be interested in based on their browsing history and purchase history. A social media platform might use a recommendation system to suggest content or connections that a user will find engaging.

Here we have used KD tree to make build this recommendation system.

K-D Tree:
A k-d tree (short for k-dimensional tree) is a type of data structure that is used to organize and search through high-dimensional data. It is particularly useful for problems that involve searching for the closest items in a dataset, such as nearest neighbor search and range search.
K-d trees work by recursively dividing the data into smaller subsets based on a chosen dimension, until each subset contains only a single item. Each node in the tree represents a subset of the data, and the tree is organized such that items that are similar in terms of the chosen dimension are grouped together in the same subset.
One of the main advantages of k-d trees is that they can be used to quickly find the nearest neighbors of a query point in a high-dimensional space. This is done by traversing the tree from the root to the leaf nodes, and pruning branches that are not likely to contain the nearest neighbors.
Another use of k-d tree is for nearest neighbor search algorithm in computer graphics and machine learning. In computer graphics, k-d trees are used for accelerating ray tracing, for example for finding the closest object that a light ray hits. In machine learning, k-d trees are used for nearest neighbor classification and regression.
In summary, k-d trees are a powerful data structure that can be used to efficiently search through high-dimensional data. They are particularly useful for nearest neighbor search, which is a common task in many fields such as computer graphics, machine learning, and computer vision.
